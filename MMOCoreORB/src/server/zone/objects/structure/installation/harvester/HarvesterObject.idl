Linking Engine3 statically or dynamically with other modules
is making a combined work based on Engine3.

cover the whole combination.

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of Engine3
give you permission to combine Engine3 program with free software
programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with
code included in the standard release of Core3 under the GNU LGPL
license (or modified versions of such code, with unchanged license).
You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the
GNU LGPL for Engine3 and the licenses of the other code concerned,
provided that you include the source code of that other code when
and as the GNU LGPL requires distribution of source code.

Note that people who make modified versions of Engine3 are not obligated
to grant this special exception for their modified versions;
it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU Lesser General Public License
gives permission to release a modified version without this exception;
this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version
which carries forward this exception.
