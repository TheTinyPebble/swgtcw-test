 Linking Engine3 statically or dynamically with other modules
 is making a combined work based on Engine3.

 cover the whole combination.

 In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of Engine3
 give you permission to combine Engine3 program with free software
 programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with
 code included in the standard release of Core3 under the GNU LGPL
 license (or modified versions of such code, with unchanged license).
 You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the
 GNU LGPL for Engine3 and the licenses of the other code concerned,
 provided that you include the source code of that other code when
 and as the GNU LGPL requires distribution of source code.

 Note that people who make modified versions of Engine3 are not obligated
 to grant this special exception for their modified versions;
 it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU Lesser General Public License
 gives permission to release a modified version without this exception;
 this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version
 which carries forward this exception.
