-- Weather System Notes
--------------------------
-- Weather ID's are: 0-4 (0 being sunny and calm)
-- When a new weather ID is chosen (delayed by newWeatherTime), the server will slowly 
-- change to that value one ID at a time (delayed by transitionTime).



----------------------------
-- Desciption of Variables
----------------------------
-- weatherEnabled: This determines if the weather will change over time.
-- Acceptable values: 0 or 1
-- Default: 1

-- startingWeatherID: This determines which weather is in place when the server starts.
-- Acceptable values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
-- A value of 5 will cause a random weather ID from 0-2 at startup.
-- Default: 5

-- levelZeroChance (percent)
-- levelOneChance (percent)
-- levelTwoChance (percent)
-- levelThreeChance (percent)
-- levelFourChance (percent)
-- These determine the chance each weather ID will be selected when new weather is chosen.
-- Acceptable range: 0-100. These values must combine to equal 100.
-- Default: 70, 14, 9, 5, 2

-- windChangeChance (percent): Determines the chance of the wind direction changing when the weather ID transitions between 3-4. 
-- Acceptable range: 0 to 100
-- Default: 50

-- newWeatherTimeMin (seconds): Determines the minimum amount of time until new weather is chosen after the previously selected weather is reached.
-- Acceptable Range: 0 to less than or equal to newWeatherTimeMax
-- Default: 600 (10 minutes)


-- newWeatherTimeMax (seconds): Determines the maximum amount of time until new weather is chosen after the previously selected weather is reached.
-- Acceptable Range: 0 to 100000
-- Default: 1800 (30 minutes)


-- transitionTimeMin (seconds): Determines the minimum amount of time until the weather transitions toward the selected weather again.
-- Acceptable Range: 0 to less than or equal to transitionTimeMax
-- Default: 120 (2 minutes)


-- transitionTimeMax (seconds): Determines the maximum amount of time until the weather transitions toward the selected weather again.
-- Acceptable Range: 0 to 100000
-- Default: 600 (10 minutes)

-----------------------------------------------------------

-- ***Optional Sandstorm Hindrance Feature***

-- This feature is only in effect (ticks) when weather ID = 4 (severe) on Tatooine and Lok.

-- sandstormEffectsEnabled: Determines whether the optional sandstorm hindrance feature is enabled.
-- Acceptable values: 0 or 1
-- Default value: 0


-- sandstormWounds: Determines how many wounds a player can receive to his primary HAM bars per sandstorm "tick".
-- Acceptable range: 0 to 500
-- Default: 15 (Tatooine), 10 (Lok)

-- sandstormWoundsMitigation: Determines how many wounds to subtract per protective item the player is wearing (5 items max).
-- Acceptable range: 0 to 500
-- Default: 3 (Tatooine), 2 (Lok)


-- sandstormKnockdownChance: Determines the percent chance that a player will be knocked down per sandstorm "tick".
-- Acceptable range: 0 to 100
-- Default: 40 (Tatooine), 30 (Lok)


-- sandstormKnockdownModifier: Determines how much knockdown chance will be added (armour) or subtracted (protective
-- clothing) per item the player is wearing (5 items max).
-- Acceptable range: 0 to 100
-- Default: 4 (Tatooine), 4 (Lok)


-- sandstormTickTime (seconds): Determines how often the sandstorm hindrances will be applied to players not in a structure or camp.
-- Acceptable range: 5 to 60 
-- Default: 10
