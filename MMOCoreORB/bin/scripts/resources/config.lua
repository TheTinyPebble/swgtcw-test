averageShiftTime = 7200000 -- In milliseconds
  --  This is the time between each time the Resource Manager schedules
  --  itself to run again.
  --  *** Default is 2 hours (7200000) ***
  --  *** Good testing time is (15000) ***

aveduration = 86400 -- In seconds
  -- This is the modifier for how long spawns are in shift
  -- Organics are in shift between (6 * aveduration) and  (22 * aveduration)
  -- Inorganics are in shift between (6 * aveduration) and (11 * aveduration)
  -- JTL resources are in shift between (13 * aveduration) and (22 * aveduration)
  -- Set to 86400 for standard SOE behavior

spawnThrottling = 50 -- *** 10-90 ***
  -- This will add a throttle to the spawner so
  -- that 90% of resources will have stats less than
  -- x * maxGate.  So if a resource has stat 0-1000
  -- and this is set at 70, 90% of resources will have 
  -- a value of < 700 and 10% > 700.
  -- Set to 90 for standard SOE behavior

lowerGateOverride = 1000 -- 1-1000  
  -- This will manually set the lower gate to this 
  -- number if it has a lower gate greater than the
  -- number entered.  ex. if a resource has a SOE gate
  -- of 850-950, and the number is set at 300, it will
  -- change the gate to 300-950.  This allows for resource
  -- quality control, especially for resources with 
  -- very high gates.  
  -- Set to 1000 for standard SOE behavior.
  
maxSpawnQuantity = 0 
  -- This value specifies the quantity that a specific resource
  -- will spawn before automatically despawning.  This value
  -- is disabled (0) by default as it is NOT standard behavior, 
  -- but it is an option for admins to have more control over resources.
  -- Set to 0 for standard SOE behavior
