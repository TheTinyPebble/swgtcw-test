## What is The Clone Wars? ##

Star Wars Galaxies The Clone Wars is an emulated version of the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies based off of the open source Core3 code created by the SWGEmu team. We are fully AGPL compliant and have all of our work listed within this repo as per the agreement with SWGEmu. If you would like to install your own server with Core3 on it, please read the instructions below. Our credits for the Clone Wars server can be found at the bottom of this page.

## What is SWGEmu? ##

Star Wars Galaxies was a massively multi-player online role playing game introduced by Sony Online Entertainment in the year 2003 and shut down in 2011.
It is this game the SWGEmu project focuses to recreate at a specific milestone referred to as Pre-CU, or Pre-Combat Upgrade. The Combat Upgrade was a set of game changes which radically changed the game-play, to the dislike of thousands of players. These changes led to the founding of this project, in an attempt to "recreate" the game as it was during the Pre-CU era.
At SWGEmu, Emulator refers to the software the SWGEmu team is building. This Emulator is meant to imitate Sony Online Entertainment's server-side software, which hosted the galaxies of Star Wars Galaxies during the Pre-CU era.
